      <h1 id = "sleep"> Sleep and Eating Schedules: </h1>
      <h2> Due to the current situation, many people do not maintain regular schedules for sleeping and eating. Use these tips to manage your schedules!</h2>
      <h2> Sleep tips: </h2>
      <h3> 1. Sleep for at least 7 to 9 hours a day to get enough energy to have an abudance of energy the next day!<br>
  2. Try to maintain a regular sleep schedule by sleeping at the same time each day around 9 PM - 11 PM and wake up around the same time as well.<br>
  3. To keep your circadium cycle going, get lots of sunlight during the day, and use blackout curtains or <a href = "https://www.amazon.com/Dream-Essentials-Escape-Sleep-Earplugs/dp/B003CGIBYQ/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1YL6ART53EDHS&keywords=dream+essentials+sleep+mask&qid=1555733234&s=gateway&sprefix=Dream+essenti%2Caps%2C182&sr=8-3"> eye masks</a> to keep the light out during night. This helps release more sleep hormones (melatonin)<br>
 
 4. Avoid electronics that emit lots of blue light or buy <a href = "https://www.swanwicksleep.com/?rfsn=401896.29075"> these nifty sunglasses that block against blue light! </a> <br>
  5. Check out this <a href="https://thepowerofwhenquiz.com/"> chronotype test</a> to know your sleep type and to <a href = "https://brightside.me/inspiration-psychology/heres-the-perfect-daily-schedule-that-corresponds-to-your-chronotype-506010/">maximize productivity</a> based on your sleep type! Lean more about chronotypes <a href = "https://www.healthline.com/health/chronotype">here.</a> <br>
 6. Get earplugs or close the door to prevent noise from getting to your brain because even when you're sleeping, your brain still processes noise!<br>
7. The material of your bed is important, but it's not very practical to buy a new one. Of course, if you want to, feel free to do so! A better way to feel comfortable in bed is to get a nice pillow made out of natural fibers such as wool, down, cotton, linen, and silk. Make sure your bedding is clean and wash regularly!<br>
 8. If you are hungry before bed, try eating a light snack less than 200 calories.<br>

</h2>
        <h3> 1. Many people are overeating. To prevent that, only eat when you are hungry and at mealtimes. You only should have 3 meals a day, with at most two light snacks. <br>
2. Don't eat at night because you won't be active enough at night to burn the calories. Eating snacks during the afternoon is better. Also not eating 2 hours before sleeptime also helps you sleep. However you shouldn't go to sleep hungry either. Check out sleep tip #8! <br>
3. Sometimes you will mistake your thirst as hunger. If it's not time to eat, drink water if you think you're hungry. Drinking water also helps you stay hydrated!<br>
4. Don't eat while doing something else. This distracts your brain and you'll often continue to eat even if you're full. That causes overeating.<br>
5. Eat one bite at a time, and eat slowly so you have time to digest and your brain can realize that you're full. <br>
6. Eat a healthy portion of fruit, veggie, protein, dairy, etc and avoid junk food (of course you can enjoy junk food once in a while :P).<br>
